# About This Blog

## Why "Ṣəḥufāna Malkəʾ"?

The phrase *"ṣəḥufāna malkəʾ"* (ጽሑፋነ፡ መልክእ፡) is found in the commonly recited Nagś za-Māḥlet (ነግሥ፡ ዘማሕሌት፡):

> ሰላም፡ ለመላእክት፡ ወለማኅበረ፡ በኵር፡ ኵሉ፨  
> ጽሑፋነ፡ መልክእ፡ ወስም፡ በሰማይ፡ ዘላዕሉ፨  
>
> Salutation to the angels and to the entire assembly of the Firstborn  
> Whose images and names are inscribed in heaven above.  

Translated quite literally, the first two words of the final line *("ṣəḥufāna malkəʾ")* mean "those written of image," the genitive here functioning in the same way as "those blind of eye" or "a man cold of heart." These two lines are a paraphrase of Hebrews 12:23 with the addition that not only are the names of the saints inscribed in heaven but also their images or likenesses — malkəʾ. Since this blog is focused on texts and manuscripts produced within the malkəʾ poetic tradition, all the persons mentioned are thus, in a sense, *"ṣəḥufāna malkəʾ"* by virtue of a malkəʾ having been composed for/about them.

## Why malkəʾ?

## Who are you?

Augustine Dickinson.

## How did you make this blog?

Quite simply, using Jekyll with a bit of Sass, some plugins in Ruby, and images via IIIF (thanks to Annona).

## Where can I read more samples of Gəʿəz poetry?

Find shorter selections with translation and brief commentary on Facebook: [@geezpoetry](https://www.facebook.com/geezpoetry).

## How can I learn Gəʿəz?

Ideally at a post-secondary institution or, the most traditional way, through a *qəne bet*. My feeling, though, is that Gəʿəz is a language best learned through reading rather than memorization or exercises. You can start with a textbook like Lambdin's or Procházka's for grammatical basics and then move right away to simple prose selections, like those in Dillmann's *Chrestomathia Aethiopica*.

## Why can't I download images?

Because the images that appear on this site are not kept here; they are served via IIIF (triple-i-eff: the International Image Interoperability Framework) directly from the institutions that own the images.

## Can you send me the images I want?

No. Contact the institution which legally owns the images.
